Rating Levels

The application assigns a performance rating at the end of each game session based on your accuracy and average time per hand, relative to the chosen timeLimit (difficulty level). Here's a breakdown of how the ratings are determined:

Beginner: This is the default or lowest rating, typically assigned if accuracy is below 50% or performance doesn't meet higher thresholds.

Intermediate: Awarded for accuracy between 50% and 69%, or for proficient play with slightly lower accuracy.

Proficient: Achieved with 70% accuracy or higher, especially if your average time is within a reasonable range (e.g., less than 60% of the time limit).

Advanced: Requires 90% accuracy or higher, with an average time per hand that is less than 70% of the timeLimit.

Expert: The highest rating, requiring 90% accuracy or higher and an impressive average time per hand that is less than 50% of the timeLimit.

These thresholds are designed to encourage both correct identification of hands and quick decision-making, which are crucial skills in poker.
